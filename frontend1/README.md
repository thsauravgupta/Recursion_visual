# Recursion Tree Visualizer

A modern React application for visualizing recursive algorithms with interactive tree diagrams.

## Features

- **Interactive Code Editor**: Write and test recursive functions
- **Template Library**: Pre-built algorithms (Fibonacci, Factorial, Binary Search, etc.)
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Control animation speed and step through execution
- **SVG Tree Visualization**: Beautiful, interactive tree diagrams
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark modes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Performance Optimized**: Modern React patterns with hooks and memoization

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd recursion-tree-visualizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage

1. Select a template algorithm or write your own recursive function
2. Enter function parameters
3. Click "Run" to analyze and visualize the recursion
4. Use the animation controls to step through execution
5. Explore the tree visualization with zoom and pan controls

## Supported Algorithms

- Fibonacci Sequence
- Factorial Calculation  
- Binary Search
- Power Function
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- Array Sum
- And more...

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Technologies Used

- React 18 with Hooks
- SVG for visualizations
- Framer Motion for animations
- Modern CSS with custom properties
- Lucide React for icons
